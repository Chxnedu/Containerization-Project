# Containerization-Project

In this project I containerized a sample webapp with multiple services running like db, rabbitmq, memcache, nginx, tomcat.
I first wrote dockerfiles for each service, to build the images
Then i wrote a docker compose yaml file to launch the images I built previously into their respective containers
